# AI-Voice-Assistant-developed-in-Python
This project is a simple AI Voice Assistant developed in Python, designed to accept voice commands, process them, and respond with spoken answers. It includes basic functionality like Wikipedia search and greeting commands. This project was later converted into an Android APK using tools like Kivy or BeeWare (assumed for deployment).
